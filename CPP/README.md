# CPP

## What it is?

The first 5 CPP modules are intended to teach the basic syntax and behaviours of C++ such as classes, abstracting, and polymorphism.

## Module 00

Module [00](https://github.com/Jules478/JulesHive/tree/main/CPP/CPP0) teaches the very basics such as reading standard input, writing to standard output, class constructors, and class attributes.

## Module 01

Module [01](https://github.com/Jules478/JulesHive/tree/main/CPP/CPP1) teaches how to manage heap memory in C++. It teaches the differences between references and pointers and outlines how to use these correctly. 

## Module 02

Module [02](https://github.com/Jules478/JulesHive/tree/main/CPP/CPP2) teaches operator overloads and how to manage them by having us build up to and create a program to determine if a given point is contained inside a triangle defined by 3 points.

## Module 03

Module [03](https://github.com/Jules478/JulesHive/tree/main/CPP/CPP3) teaches inheritance and ultimately demonstrates the risk of diamond inheritance when a derived class inherits from two classes that both have the same base class. 

## Module 04

Module [04](https://github.com/Jules478/JulesHive/tree/main/CPP/CPP4) teaches polymorphism and abstract classes as well as how to create an approximation of an interface in C++ as these are not part of the C++ standard.
